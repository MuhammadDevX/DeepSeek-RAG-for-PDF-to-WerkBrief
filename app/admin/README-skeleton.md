# Admin Page Loading Skeleton

This folder now contains a comprehensive loading skeleton system for the admin page:

## Files Added:

### `AdminSkeleton.tsx`

- **AdminSkeleton**: Full page skeleton shown when the entire admin page is loading
- **UserCardSkeleton**: Individual user card skeleton component (exported for reuse)
- **SearchResultsSkeleton**: Skeleton for search results section (exported for reuse)

### `loading.tsx`

- Next.js loading UI that automatically shows the `AdminSkeleton` when the admin page is loading

## How it works:

1. **Page Loading**: When users navigate to `/admin`, Next.js automatically shows the `loading.tsx` file while the main `page.tsx` is loading
2. **Search Loading**: The `SearchUsers` component already has its own loading state with a spinner
3. **Individual Components**: The skeleton components can be reused in other parts of the app if needed

## Features:

- ✅ Matches the exact design and layout of the real admin page
- ✅ Includes animated pulse effects for a polished loading experience
- ✅ Supports both light and dark themes
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Reusable skeleton components for other parts of the app
- ✅ Follows the same styling patterns as the real components

## Usage Example:

If you want to show skeleton results while search is happening, you could modify the main page:

```tsx
// In the main page.tsx, you could add:
{query && isLoading && <SearchResultsSkeleton />}
{query && !isLoading && users.length > 0 && (
  // ... real user cards
)}
```

The skeleton provides excellent user experience by showing users what content is coming while maintaining the visual hierarchy and layout.
