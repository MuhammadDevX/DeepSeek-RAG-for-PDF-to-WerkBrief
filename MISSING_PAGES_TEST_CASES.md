# Missing Pages Algorithm - Test Cases

## Algorithm Logic

```typescript
const successfullyProcessedPages: number[] = [];
const maxProcessedPage = Math.max(...successfullyProcessedPages);
const missingPages: number[] = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= maxProcessedPage; i++) {
  if (!successfullyProcessedPages.includes(i)) {
    missingPages.push(i);
  }
}
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: All Pages Successful ✅

```
Input: successfullyProcessedPages = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
maxProcessedPage = 5
Check 1-5: All present
Output: missingPages = []
UI: ✅ Green - "All 5 pages processed successfully"
```

### Test Case 2: Middle Pages Missing ⚠️

```
Input: successfullyProcessedPages = [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
maxProcessedPage = 8
Check 1-8: Missing 3, 5, 6
Output: missingPages = [3, 5, 6]
UI: ⚠️ Amber - "Missing Pages: 3, 5, 6 (3 gaps found between pages 1-8)"
```

### Test Case 3: First Page Missing ⚠️

```
Input: successfullyProcessedPages = [2, 3, 4]
maxProcessedPage = 4
Check 1-4: Missing 1
Output: missingPages = [1]
UI: ⚠️ Amber - "Missing Pages: 1 (1 gap found between pages 1-4)"
```

### Test Case 4: Trailing Pages Not Reported ✅

```
Input: successfullyProcessedPages = [1, 2, 3]
Total PDF Pages = 10
maxProcessedPage = 3
Check 1-3: All present
Output: missingPages = []
Note: Pages 4-10 not checked (user can see they're missing)
UI: ✅ Green - "All pages processed successfully" (within 1-3 range)
```

### Test Case 5: Only Middle Page Successful ⚠️

```
Input: successfullyProcessedPages = [5]
maxProcessedPage = 5
Check 1-5: Missing 1, 2, 3, 4
Output: missingPages = [1, 2, 3, 4]
UI: ⚠️ Amber - "Missing Pages: 1, 2, 3, 4 (4 gaps found between pages 1-5)"
```

### Test Case 6: No Pages Successful ✅

```
Input: successfullyProcessedPages = []
maxProcessedPage = 0 (Math.max([]) = -Infinity → handled with length check)
No loop execution
Output: missingPages = []
UI: ✅ Green - "All 0 pages processed" (edge case, but safe)
```

### Test Case 7: Non-Sequential Success ⚠️

```
Input: successfullyProcessedPages = [1, 5, 10, 15]
maxProcessedPage = 15
Check 1-15: Missing 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14
Output: missingPages = [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14]
UI: ⚠️ Amber - "Missing Pages: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7... (11 gaps found between pages 1-15)"
```

## Edge Cases

### Empty PDF

```
docs.length = 0
successfullyProcessedPages = []
missingPages = []
totalPages = 0
Result: Safe handling, no errors
```

### Single Page PDF - Success

```
successfullyProcessedPages = [1]
maxProcessedPage = 1
missingPages = []
UI: ✅ "All 1 page processed successfully"
```

### Single Page PDF - Failure

```
successfullyProcessedPages = []
maxProcessedPage = 0
missingPages = []
Note: Page 1 failure not reported (no max page to check against)
This is fine - user sees 0 products extracted
```

## Comparison: Old vs New Approach

### Old Approach (Set-based)

```typescript
const allPageNumbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
const successfullyProcessedPages = new Set([1, 2, 4, 7, 8]);
const missingPages = Array.from(allPageNumbers)
  .filter((p) => !successfullyProcessedPages.has(p))
  .sort((a, b) => a - b);
// Result: [3, 5, 6, 9, 10]
// Reports trailing pages 9, 10 (user can see these anyway)
```

### New Approach (Gap detection)

```typescript
const successfullyProcessedPages = [1, 2, 4, 7, 8];
const maxProcessedPage = 8;
const missingPages = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
  if (!successfullyProcessedPages.includes(i)) {
    missingPages.push(i);
  }
}
// Result: [3, 5, 6]
// Only reports gaps in processed range (more useful!)
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **User Perspective**: "Show me which pages failed in the middle" not "count all missing pages"
2. **Visual Context**: Trailing pages are obvious from product count
3. **Simplicity**: One loop, one array, clear logic
4. **Performance**: No upfront scan of all documents
5. **Focus**: Highlights unexpected gaps, not expected trailing pages

## UI Examples

### Scenario A: 10-page PDF, processed 1-8, pages 3,5 failed

```
✅ Products: 150
⚠️  Missing Pages: 3, 5 (2 gaps found between pages 1-8)
Note: User can infer pages 9-10 weren't processed (only 8 pages worth of products)
```

### Scenario B: 10-page PDF, all 10 processed successfully

```
✅ Products: 200
✅ All 10 pages processed successfully
```

### Scenario C: 10-page PDF, processed 1-10, page 7 failed

```
✅ Products: 180
⚠️  Missing Pages: 7 (1 gap found between pages 1-10)
```
