# File Upload Issue Analysis & Solution

## Problem Summary

Files larger than 100MB were stopping at approximately 80% during upload to DigitalOcean Spaces.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **XMLHttpRequest Timeout (PRIMARY ISSUE)**

- **Location**: `lib/upload-utils.ts` line 176
- **Issue**: Timeout was set to 600,000ms (10 minutes)
- **Problem**: For files >100MB on slower connections, 10 minutes is insufficient
- **Symptom**: Upload appears stuck at ~80% when timeout is reached

### 2. **Missing Multipart Upload Support**

- **Issue**: Using single PUT request for all file sizes
- **Problem**: Large files (>100MB) are prone to:
  - Network interruptions
  - Timeout issues
  - No retry mechanism for failed uploads
  - Browser memory constraints

### 3. **Server Configuration Gaps**

- **Issue**: Custom server.js didn't configure timeouts
- **Problem**: Default HTTP timeouts could kill long-running uploads

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Solution 1: Multipart Upload for Large Files (>100MB)

**Files Modified:**

- `app/api/upload/presigned-url/route.ts` - Added multipart initialization
- `app/api/upload/multipart-part/route.ts` - NEW: Handles individual part uploads
- `app/api/upload/complete-multipart/route.ts` - NEW: Completes multipart upload
- `lib/upload-utils.ts` - Implemented smart upload routing

**How it works:**

1. Files >100MB automatically use multipart upload
2. Files split into 10MB chunks
3. Each chunk uploaded independently with retry logic (3 attempts per chunk)
4. Progress tracked across all chunks
5. After all parts upload, S3 combines them into single file

**Benefits:**

- ✅ No timeout issues (each 10MB chunk uploads quickly)
- ✅ Automatic retry on network failures
- ✅ Better progress tracking
- ✅ More reliable for large files
- ✅ Industry standard for large file uploads

### ✅ Solution 2: Increased Timeout for Simple Uploads (<100MB)

**File Modified:** `lib/upload-utils.ts`

- Increased timeout from 10 minutes to 30 minutes (1,800,000ms)
- Provides buffer for slower connections on medium-sized files

### ✅ Solution 3: Server Timeout Configuration

**File Modified:** `server.js`

- Added request/response timeouts: 1 hour (3,600,000ms)
- Added server-level timeout: 1 hour
- Ensures long-running uploads won't be killed server-side

## Technical Details

### Multipart Upload Flow:

```
1. Client detects file >100MB
   ↓
2. Request multipart upload initialization
   ↓
3. Receive uploadId from S3
   ↓
4. For each 10MB chunk:
   - Get presigned URL for part
   - Upload chunk (with 3 retry attempts)
   - Store ETag from response
   ↓
5. After all parts uploaded:
   - Send complete multipart request with all ETags
   - S3 combines chunks into single file
   ↓
6. Return success with file URL
```

### Chunk Size Considerations:

- **10MB chunks** chosen for optimal balance:
  - Small enough: Quick uploads, minimal timeout risk
  - Large enough: Not too many API calls
  - Industry standard for S3 multipart uploads

### Retry Logic:

- Each chunk gets 3 upload attempts
- 1-second delay between retries
- Prevents transient network issues from failing entire upload

## Configuration Summary

### Next.js Config (`next.config.ts`):

```typescript
experimental: {
  serverActions: {
    bodySizeLimit: "200mb", // Already configured
  },
}
```

### Upload Limits:

- Maximum file size: 500MB
- Multipart threshold: 100MB
- Chunk size: 10MB
- Part upload timeout: 1 hour per part
- Simple upload timeout: 30 minutes
- Retry attempts per chunk: 3

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases:

1. **Small files (<10MB)**: Should use simple upload
2. **Medium files (10-100MB)**: Should use simple upload with 30min timeout
3. **Large files (100-200MB)**: Should use multipart upload
4. **Very large files (200-500MB)**: Should use multipart upload
5. **Network interruption**: Should auto-retry failed chunks

### Monitoring:

- Watch browser console for upload method selection
- Monitor progress percentage
- Check for retry attempts on unstable connections
- Verify upload speed and remaining time estimates

## DigitalOcean Spaces Compatibility

All implementations are fully compatible with DigitalOcean Spaces:

- ✅ Uses AWS S3 SDK (Spaces is S3-compatible)
- ✅ Multipart upload supported by Spaces
- ✅ Presigned URLs work identically
- ✅ No Spaces-specific limitations violated

## Next Steps

1. **Test the changes:**

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with large file (>100MB):**

   - Upload should automatically use multipart
   - Console will show: "Using multipart upload for XXX.XXmb file"
   - Progress should be smooth without stalling

3. **Monitor logs:**

   - Check for successful chunk uploads
   - Verify retry attempts if network is unstable
   - Confirm final completion message

4. **Production deployment:**
   - Build and deploy
   - Test in production environment
   - Monitor for any timeout or memory issues

## Troubleshooting

### If uploads still fail:

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify DigitalOcean Spaces credentials
3. Confirm CORS settings allow multipart uploads
4. Check network stability
5. Verify bucket permissions for multipart operations

### CORS Configuration for DigitalOcean Spaces:

Ensure your Spaces bucket allows:

```json
{
  "CORSRules": [
    {
      "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
      "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
      "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
      "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** ETag header exposure is crucial for multipart uploads!

## Performance Improvements

### Before:

- 10-minute timeout on all uploads
- Single request for entire file
- No retry mechanism
- Fails at ~80% on large files

### After:

- 30-minute timeout for files <100MB
- Multipart upload for files >100MB
- Automatic retry (3 attempts per chunk)
- Reliable uploads up to 500MB
- Better progress tracking
- Industry-standard implementation
