# State Persistence Verification

## Current Implementation

The `WerkbriefProvider` context wraps the entire application at the root layout level:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
<ClerkProvider>
  <WerkbriefProvider>
    <Navbar />
    {children}
  </WerkbriefProvider>
</ClerkProvider>
```

This means that the context state should persist across all page navigations within the app.

## State That Persists

The following werkbrief data is maintained in the context:

1. **Core Data**:

   - `result` - Original werkbrief data from PDF
   - `editedFields` - User-edited version of the data
   - `checkedFields` - Which items are selected for export

2. **History**:

   - `deletedRows` - Deleted items with undo capability

3. **UI State**:
   - `searchTerm`, `currentPage`, `itemsPerPage`
   - `sortConfig`, `isTableExpanded`, `showFilters`

## Expected Behavior

✅ **What SHOULD work**:

- Navigate: Werkbrief Generator → Admin → Back to Werkbrief Generator
- All edits, merges, and deletions should be preserved
- Downloaded/copied Excel should reflect all changes

✅ **Why it works**:

- Context provider wraps entire app
- React Context maintains state in memory
- State only resets when:
  - User explicitly clicks "Reset" or uploads new PDF
  - Browser is refreshed (page reload)
  - User calls `resetAllState()` function

## Testing Steps

To verify state persistence:

1. Generate a werkbrief from PDF
2. Make some edits (change values, merge items, delete rows)
3. Navigate to Admin page or Expand page
4. Navigate back to Werkbrief Generator page
5. Verify all your edits are still there
6. Download/Copy Excel to verify changes are preserved

## If State Is Lost

If you're experiencing state loss on navigation, it could be due to:

1. **Hard Navigation**: Using `<a>` tags instead of Next.js `<Link>` components
2. **Page Refresh**: The browser is actually reloading
3. **Multiple Context Instances**: Duplicate providers (should not be the case here)

## Solution Already Implemented

The context is already properly set up! All your edits should persist when navigating between pages. The state will only be lost if:

- You refresh the browser (F5)
- You upload a new PDF (which intentionally resets the state)
- You explicitly click a reset button

Try it now:

1. Edit some werkbrief data
2. Navigate to another page (Admin/Expand)
3. Come back - your edits should still be there! ✨
