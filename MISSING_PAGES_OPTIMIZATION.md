# Missing Pages Detection - Simplified Approach

## Problem with Previous Implementation

The previous approach was unnecessarily complex:

- Created a Set of all page numbers upfront
- Tracked successfully processed pages in another Set
- Calculated difference between the two Sets

This required:

- Extra loop through all documents before processing
- Two data structures (Set for all pages, Set for successful pages)
- More complex logic

## New Simplified Approach

**Key Insight**: We only care about gaps in the range from page 1 to the highest successfully processed page. Users can visually see if trailing pages are missing.

### Algorithm

```typescript
// 1. Track successful pages as we process them
const successfullyProcessedPages: number[] = [];

// 2. After processing, find the highest page we successfully processed
const maxProcessedPage = Math.max(...successfullyProcessedPages);

// 3. Check for gaps from 1 to max
const missingPages: number[] = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= maxProcessedPage; i++) {
  if (!successfullyProcessedPages.includes(i)) {
    missingPages.push(i);
  }
}
```

### Example

If we process pages: `[1, 2, 4, 7, 8]`

- Max processed page: `8`
- Check pages 1-8: Missing `[3, 5, 6]`
- **We don't check beyond page 8** - users can see if page 9, 10, etc. are missing

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler**: One array instead of two Sets  
✅ **Fewer operations**: No upfront scan of all documents  
✅ **Clearer intent**: "Find gaps in sequence"  
✅ **User-friendly**: Focus on gaps users might miss, not trailing pages

## Code Changes

### Before:

```typescript
// Track all page numbers and successfully processed pages
const allPageNumbers = new Set<number>();
const successfullyProcessedPages = new Set<number>();

// First, collect all page numbers from the PDF
docs.forEach((doc, index) => {
  const pageNumber = doc.metadata?.loc?.pageNumber || index + 1;
  allPageNumbers.add(pageNumber);
});

// ... processing ...
successfullyProcessedPages.add(pageNumber);

// Calculate difference
const missingPages = Array.from(allPageNumbers)
  .filter((pageNum) => !successfullyProcessedPages.has(pageNum))
  .sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

### After:

```typescript
// Track successfully processed page numbers
const successfullyProcessedPages: number[] = [];
const totalPages = docs.length;

// ... processing ...
successfullyProcessedPages.push(pageNumber);

// Find gaps from 1 to max processed page
const maxProcessedPage =
  successfullyProcessedPages.length > 0
    ? Math.max(...successfullyProcessedPages)
    : 0;

const missingPages: number[] = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= maxProcessedPage; i++) {
  if (!successfullyProcessedPages.includes(i)) {
    missingPages.push(i);
  }
}
```

## UI Impact

The UI message changes from:

- ❌ "Missing Pages: 3, 5, 6 (3 of 10 pages could not be processed)"

To:

- ✅ "Missing Pages: 3, 5, 6 (3 gaps found between pages 1-8)"

This is clearer because:

- Shows the range we're checking (1-8)
- "gaps" is more intuitive than "of X total pages"
- User understands we're not checking trailing pages

## Performance

| Metric          | Before      | After   |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Data structures | 2 Sets      | 1 Array |
| Upfront scans   | 1 full scan | 0       |
| Memory          | O(2n)       | O(n)    |
| Complexity      | O(n log n)  | O(n)    |

Where `n` = number of pages

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No pages processed**: `maxProcessedPage = 0`, `missingPages = []` ✅
2. **All pages successful**: Loop finds no gaps, `missingPages = []` ✅
3. **Only page 5 processed**: Finds gaps `[1, 2, 3, 4]` ✅
4. **Trailing pages missing**: Not reported (by design) ✅

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Process PDF with all pages successful → missingPages = []
- [ ] Process PDF with page 3 failing → missingPages = [3]
- [ ] Process PDF with pages 2, 5, 7 failing → missingPages = [2, 5, 7]
- [ ] Process PDF where only page 10 succeeds → missingPages = [1-9]
- [ ] Process PDF with trailing pages failing → Not in missingPages (expected)
