# Upload Simplification - Single Presigned URL with 30-Minute Timeout

## Changes Summary

### Issue Addressed

The multipart upload implementation was causing issues in the frontend and other parts of the application. Reverted to a simpler, more stable single presigned URL approach.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Multipart Upload Logic

- ❌ Removed multipart upload branching logic from `uploadFileToSpacesWithProgress()`
- ❌ Removed `uploadWithSimpleMethod()` helper function
- ❌ Removed `uploadWithMultipart()` helper function
- ❌ Deleted `/api/upload/multipart-part` API route
- ❌ Deleted `/api/upload/complete-multipart` API route

### 2. Multipart Upload API Routes

The following directories and files were completely removed:

- `app/api/upload/multipart-part/route.ts`
- `app/api/upload/complete-multipart/route.ts`

## What Was Kept/Updated

### 1. Single Presigned URL Approach

**File: `app/api/upload/presigned-url/route.ts`**

- ✅ Simplified to only handle single presigned URL generation
- ✅ Removed `CreateMultipartUploadCommand` import
- ✅ Removed `useMultipart` parameter handling
- ✅ Removed multipart conditional logic
- ✅ **Increased presigned URL expiration from 1 hour to 2 hours** (7200 seconds)
- ✅ Supports files up to 500MB

### 2. Single Upload Method

**File: `lib/upload-utils.ts`**

- ✅ Simplified `uploadFileToSpacesWithProgress()` to single upload path
- ✅ **Confirmed 30-minute timeout** (1,800,000ms) on XMLHttpRequest
- ✅ Removed all multipart-related code
- ✅ Clean, straightforward upload flow
- ✅ Progress tracking maintained
- ✅ Better error messages for timeout

### 3. Server Configuration

**File: `server.js`**

- ✅ Maintains 1-hour server timeouts (from previous changes)
- ✅ Request and response timeouts set to 3,600,000ms

### 4. Next.js Configuration

**File: `next.config.ts`**

- ✅ Maintains `bodySizeLimit: "200mb"` for server actions
- ✅ Server request timeout remains at 1 hour

## Current Upload Configuration

### Timeouts

| Component       | Timeout                  | Purpose                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| XMLHttpRequest  | 30 minutes (1,800,000ms) | Client-side upload timeout   |
| Presigned URL   | 2 hours (7200s)          | URL validity period          |
| Server Request  | 1 hour (3,600,000ms)     | Server-side request timeout  |
| Server Response | 1 hour (3,600,000ms)     | Server-side response timeout |

### Limits

- **Max File Size**: 500MB
- **File Type**: PDF only
- **Upload Method**: Single presigned URL PUT request

## Upload Flow

```
1. User selects file
   ↓
2. Frontend validates file (PDF, <500MB)
   ↓
3. Request presigned URL from /api/upload/presigned-url
   - Send: fileName, fileType, fileSize
   - Receive: presignedUrl, fileKey, fileUrl
   ↓
4. Upload file directly to DigitalOcean Spaces using XMLHttpRequest
   - Method: PUT
   - Timeout: 30 minutes
   - Progress tracking enabled
   ↓
5. Upload completes
   - Success: Return fileKey and fileUrl
   - Failure: Return error message
```

## Benefits of Single Upload Approach

### ✅ Simplicity

- Single code path for all file sizes
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Fewer API calls
- Less complexity in error handling

### ✅ Reliability

- No coordination between multiple parts
- No need to track ETags
- Fewer points of failure
- Direct upload to DigitalOcean Spaces

### ✅ Performance

- Single HTTP connection
- No overhead from multiple API calls
- Browser handles upload buffering efficiently

### ✅ Compatibility

- Works with all file sizes up to 500MB
- No special CORS requirements
- Standard S3-compatible presigned URL approach

## Potential Considerations

### For Files Over 100MB

While the single upload approach works, here are some considerations:

**Pros:**

- Simpler implementation
- Fewer moving parts
- Works well with stable connections

**Cons:**

- If connection drops, entire upload fails (no resume)
- Single timeout period applies to entire file
- More memory usage for very large files

**Mitigation:**

- 30-minute timeout is generous for most connections
- 2-hour presigned URL validity allows for retries
- Server timeouts are set to 1 hour
- DigitalOcean Spaces handles the upload efficiently

### If Issues Persist with Large Files

If you still experience issues with files >100MB:

1. **Check Network Stability**

   - Verify stable internet connection
   - Test with smaller files first
   - Monitor browser console for errors

2. **Increase Timeouts Further** (if needed)

   ```typescript
   // In upload-utils.ts
   xhr.timeout = 3600000; // 60 minutes

   // In presigned-url/route.ts
   expiresIn: 10800, // 3 hours
   ```

3. **Optimize File Size**

   - Compress PDFs before upload
   - Remove unnecessary embedded images
   - Use PDF optimization tools

4. **Check DigitalOcean Spaces Settings**
   - Verify bucket permissions
   - Check for any rate limiting
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases

1. **Small file (< 10MB)**: Should upload quickly
2. **Medium file (10-50MB)**: Should upload within a few minutes
3. **Large file (50-100MB)**: Should upload within 10-15 minutes
4. **Very large file (100-200MB)**: Should upload within 20-30 minutes
5. **Max size file (200-500MB)**: Should upload within 30 minutes

### What to Monitor

```javascript
// Browser console will show:
"Uploading XXX.XXmb file";
// Progress updates with speed and time remaining
```

### Success Criteria

- Upload progress reaches 100%
- No timeout errors
- File appears in DigitalOcean Spaces
- File URL is accessible

## Code Quality

### Files Without Errors

✅ `app/api/upload/presigned-url/route.ts` - No TypeScript/ESLint errors
✅ `lib/upload-utils.ts` - No TypeScript/ESLint errors
✅ All upload-related code is clean and error-free

### Code Cleanliness

- Removed all unused imports
- Removed all dead code
- Single responsibility per function
- Clear error messages
- Consistent coding style

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert these changes, the previous multipart implementation is in the git history. You can recover it with:

```powershell
git log --oneline  # Find the commit before this change
git checkout <commit-hash> -- app/api/upload/ lib/upload-utils.ts
```

## Summary

The upload system has been simplified to use a **single presigned URL approach** with:

- ✅ **30-minute XMLHttpRequest timeout** for client-side uploads
- ✅ **2-hour presigned URL validity** for retries if needed
- ✅ **1-hour server timeouts** to prevent server-side issues
- ✅ **Simple, reliable code** with fewer points of failure
- ✅ **Full support for files up to 500MB**

All multipart upload complexity has been removed, making the system more maintainable and less prone to frontend integration issues.
